# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2024-05-04

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **Destiny Herald** collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our open-source Android application (the "App").

## Information Collection and Use

### Crash Reporting

We use [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics) to collect basic analytics for crash reporting purposes only. This service may collect certain information automatically when you use the App, including but not limited to:

- Device Information such as device model, operating system version, and orientation.
- Log Information that includes the stack trace of crash information. The stack trace *does not* include breadcrumb information.

This information is used solely for the purpose of identifying and fixing issues to improve the stability and performance of the App. We *do not* collect or store any additional information about you, other than basic information for crash reports.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We *will not* share crash reports and related information with third-party service providers, other than Google Crashlytics.

We may disclose crash reports and related information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, or investigate and prevent wrongdoing or misuse of the App.

## Permissions
The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
