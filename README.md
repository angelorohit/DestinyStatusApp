# Destiny Herald
A native Android app for [bungiehelp.org](https://bungiehelp.org/)

Made with ❤️ for Guardians who'd like to view Bungie's Tweets without a Twitter account!

### No ads, No monetization, No analytics tracking, No account needed
As a Destiny2 player, I've found it difficult to stay up-to-date with Bungie's status updates. I decided to build this app to solve a real-world problem of mine. I will slowly make improvements to the app over time, but it did not cost me a dime to make. I'm opening the source so that others can contribute, learn or, simply use what I've made.
